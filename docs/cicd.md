# CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the continuous integration and delivery pipeline for vc-common-service. It covers trigger behavior, image and chart publishing strategies, required secrets, notifications, and deferred scope.

## Trigger Matrix

| Event | Workflows / Jobs Activated |
|-------|---------------------------|
| `pull_request` | ci-checks (lint, build, test, helm) |
| `push` to `main` | ci-checks → publish-image → deploy-dev → notify-teams |
| `push` tag `v*` | ci-checks → publish-image → publish-chart → notify-teams |

**How it works:**

- **Pull requests** run CI checks only. No artifacts are published and no notifications are sent.
- **Pushes to `main`** (merge commits) run CI checks, then build and publish a multi-arch container image to GHCR, then deploy it to the dev environment via `helm upgrade`, then notify the team via Teams.
- **Version tags** (`v1.2.3`, `v2.0.0`, etc.) run CI checks, publish the container image with semver tags, package and publish the Helm chart as an OCI artifact, then notify the team.

CI checks always gate downstream jobs — if lint, build, or test fails, no artifact is published.

## Image Tagging Strategy

Images are published to `ghcr.io/bcgov/vc-common-service`.

| Trigger | Tags Produced | Behavior |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Push to `main` | `sha-<7char>`, `main` | `sha-<7char>` is immutable (one digest per commit). `main` is a moving tag that always points to the latest successful build from the default branch. |
| Push `v*` tag | `sha-<7char>`, `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, `<major>.<minor>`, `latest` | The commit-pinned `sha-<7char>` tag is produced on every non-PR build alongside the semver tags. Full semver is immutable for that release. `<major>.<minor>` and `latest` are moving tags that advance with each new release. |

**Examples:**

- Merge commit `abc1234` to main → tags `sha-abc1234` + `main`
- Tag `v1.2.3` (commit `abc1234`) → tags `sha-abc1234` + `1.2.3` + `1.2` + `latest`

The image is built for both `linux/amd64` (OpenShift, CI runners) and `linux/arm64` (Apple Silicon local dev) and published as a single manifest list.

## Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Rotation |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Authenticates to GHCR for pushing container images and Helm chart OCI artifacts | Auto-rotated by GitHub at the start of each workflow run — no manual action needed |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Delivers Adaptive Card notifications to the team's Microsoft Teams channel | Manual rotation via Power Automate; update the repository secret when the webhook URL changes |
| `OPENSHIFT_SERVER` | API URL of the OpenShift Silver cluster, used by `deploy-dev` to deploy pushes to `main` | Static; platform-provided |
| `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` | Token of the dev-namespace pipeline ServiceAccount, used by `deploy-dev` | Regenerate SA token; update repository secret |
| `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` | `<license-plate>-dev` namespace name, used by `deploy-dev` | Static |

`GITHUB_TOKEN` is automatically available in all workflows. `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` must be configured as a repository secret by a maintainer with admin access. The `OPENSHIFT_*` secrets are the same ones used by the PR-environment pipeline (see [Required Secrets and Variables](#required-secrets-and-variables) below).

## Chart Publishing

The Helm chart is published as an OCI artifact to `oci://ghcr.io/bcgov/charts/vc-common-service`.

**Key behaviors:**

- Published **only on `v*` tags** — pushes to `main` do not produce a chart artifact.
- Version is derived from the git tag by stripping the `v` prefix (e.g., `v1.2.3` → chart version `1.2.3`). Both `version` and `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml` are set to this value.
- Before publishing, the chart is validated with `helm lint` and `helm template` against default values. If either check fails, the job fails before any push occurs.
- Dependencies are resolved via `helm dependency build` before packaging.
- If the chart directory (`charts/vc-common-service/`) does not exist, the pipeline gracefully skips chart publishing and remains green. This allows `cd.yml` to merge before the chart PR without breaking builds.

**Why a separate `/charts/` GHCR path?**

Both the container image and the Helm chart use semver as OCI tags (e.g., `1.2.3`). If they shared the same GHCR repository, tag `1.2.3` would collide — one artifact would overwrite the other. The separate `ghcr.io/bcgov/charts/vc-common-service` path avoids this namespace collision entirely.

## Teams Notifications

The pipeline posts an Adaptive Card to Microsoft Teams on both success and failure outcomes.

**Card contents:**

- Pipeline status (success / failure) with color accent (green / red)
- Repository name
- Git ref (branch or tag)
- Commit SHA (7-character short form)
- Image reference (if published)
- Chart version (if published)
- Actor (who triggered the run)
- Link to the workflow run

**Graceful degradation:**

- If `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` is **not set or empty**, the notification step logs a warning and exits with code 0. The pipeline stays green.
- If the webhook POST returns a **non-2xx response or times out** (30-second limit), the error is logged but the step exits with code 0. Notification failures never fail the pipeline.

## Fork Behavior

Publish jobs are guarded with `if: github.repository_owner == 'bcgov'`. Forks cannot push images or charts to the bcgov GHCR namespace. CI checks still run on fork PRs via the `ci.yml` workflow.

## Concurrency

- **CD pipeline (`cd.yml`):** Concurrency group `cd-<ref>` with `cancel-in-progress: false`. Concurrent pushes to the same ref queue rather than cancel, preventing half-pushed state (e.g., image pushed but chart or notification abandoned).
- **CI workflow (`ci.yml`):** Concurrency group `ci-<ref>` with `cancel-in-progress: true`. Superseded PR pushes cancel stale runs since nothing is published.

## Deferred: Phase 2 Scope

Deploying to the dev environment on pushes to `main` (`deploy-dev` job in `cd.yml`, via `oc-setup` + `helm upgrade`) is already implemented. The following capabilities are still **not implemented** and are planned for a future phase:

- **ArgoCD wiring** for test and production environments via a separate gitops repository
- **OpenShift sealed secrets management** for environment-specific configuration
- **Automatic rollback** on failed health checks after deployment

These will be added once the gitops repository structure is established.

## PR Environments

Ephemeral review environments are deployed for every non-draft pull request against `main`. Each PR gets an isolated Helm release, a dedicated database, and a unique URL in the team's dev namespace on OpenShift Silver.

### Trigger Matrix

| Event | Types | Workflow | Effect |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| `pull_request` | `opened`, `synchronize`, `reopened`, `ready_for_review` | `pr-deploy.yml` | Build PR image → provision database → deploy release → post comment |
| `pull_request` | `closed`, `converted_to_draft` | `pr-cleanup.yml` | Uninstall release → drop database → delete image tags → update comment |

Documentation-only changes (`docs/**`, `**/*.md`) skip the deploy workflow. The cleanup workflow has no path filter — it always runs on close/draft to ensure teardown even if the PR never deployed.

### Naming Scheme

| Resource | Pattern | Example (PR #42) |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Helm release | `pr-<N>-vc-common-service` | `pr-42-vc-common-service` |
| Route URL | `pr-<N>-vc-common-service-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca` | `pr-42-vc-common-service-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca` |
| Image tags | `pr-<N>` (moving) + `pr-<N>-<short-sha>` (immutable) | `pr-42` + `pr-42-a1b2c3d` |
| Database | `vc_pr_<N>` | `vc_pr_42` |
| Instance label | `app.kubernetes.io/instance=pr-<N>-vc-common-service` | — |

### Lifecycle

1. **PR opened / updated** — the deploy workflow builds an amd64-only image tagged `pr-<N>-<short-sha>`, creates the database `vc_pr_<N>` idempotently on the shared dev PostgreSQL, and runs `helm upgrade --install` with the in-repo chart and `values-pr.yaml` overlay. A sticky PR comment is posted (or updated) with the environment URL, health endpoint, image tag, and commit SHA.
2. **Subsequent pushes** — the same workflow re-runs. The immutable image tag changes (new commit SHA), so Kubernetes rolls the pods naturally. The sticky comment is updated in place.
3. **PR converted to draft** — triggers the cleanup workflow, tearing everything down.
4. **PR marked ready** — triggers `ready_for_review`, re-deploying the environment.
5. **PR closed / merged** — the cleanup workflow uninstalls the Helm release, deletes leftover objects by label selector, drops the database with `DROP DATABASE ... WITH (FORCE)`, and deletes `pr-<N>*` image tags from GHCR.

### Preflight Gate

Both workflows include a `preflight` job, but the checks differ:

- **`pr-deploy.yml`** checks repository ownership (`bcgov`), fork status, and whether the PR is a draft; maps `OPENSHIFT_SERVER`, `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN`, and `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` into env vars and tests they are non-empty; exposes `build` and `deploy` outputs that gate all downstream jobs.
- **`pr-cleanup.yml`** only checks repository ownership (no fork or draft check — cleanup always runs on close/draft regardless) and the same three OpenShift secrets; it exposes only a `deploy` output (there is no image build on cleanup, so no `build` output exists).

When deploy secrets are missing, cluster jobs are skipped with a notice — the workflow run stays green. The image build (deploy workflow) requires only eligibility, not deploy secrets, so PR images are still published before cluster infrastructure exists.

### Required Secrets and Variables

| Name | Kind | Purpose | Rotation |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| `OPENSHIFT_SERVER` | Secret | API URL of the OpenShift Silver cluster | Static; platform-provided |
| `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` | Secret | Token of the dev-namespace pipeline ServiceAccount | Regenerate SA token; update repository secret |
| `OPENSHIFT_NAMESPACE` | Secret | `<license-plate>-dev` namespace name | Static |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Built-in | GHCR push/delete, PR comments, deployments | Auto-rotated per run |
| `PR_DB_WORKLOAD` | Variable | Kubernetes workload ref of the PR PostgreSQL instance (e.g. `statefulset/vc-common-service-pr-db`), used for `oc exec` provisioning | Update if the PR DB workload changes |
| `PR_DB_HOST` | Variable | Optional override for the app's `config.DB_HOST` in PR releases; when unset, the `DB_HOST` default baked into `values-pr.yaml` applies | Update if the PR DB Service name changes |
| `PR_DB_OWNER` | Variable | PostgreSQL role owning `vc_pr_<N>` databases (matches `vc-common-service-pr-secret`'s `DB_USERNAME`; defaults to `app` when unset) | Update if the application DB user changes |

### External Prerequisites

These are **not** provisioned by the pipeline and must exist before PR environments can fully deploy:

1. **PR PostgreSQL instance** — a dedicated PostgreSQL instance in the dev namespace (`vc-common-service-pr-db`) shared by all PR environments. The `PR_DB_WORKLOAD` variable points at its workload (for `oc exec` provisioning); the app connects to its Service via the `DB_HOST` default in `values-pr.yaml` (or the `PR_DB_HOST` override). Superuser access happens only inside the pod via `oc exec`, connecting as the fixed `postgres` superuser (the official postgres image's default; no `POSTGRES_USER` env var is set on the pod) — no database password is stored in GitHub. Until provisioned, the pr-database action skips gracefully. The instance also needs an ingress NetworkPolicy admitting pods labeled `app.kubernetes.io/name: vc-common-service` on 5432 (the namespace is deny-by-default).
2. **Application Secret** — a pre-provisioned Secret named `vc-common-service-pr-secret` in the dev namespace containing `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` for the shared application role. PR releases reference it via `secret.existingSecret` in `values-pr.yaml`; the role itself must exist on the PR PostgreSQL instance (the pipeline creates databases, never roles).
3. **Pipeline ServiceAccount** — an OpenShift ServiceAccount in the dev namespace with permissions to manage Helm release objects and `oc exec` into the database pod. Its token is stored in `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN`.
4. **GHCR package Admin role** — deleting versions of the org-owned `vc-common-service` package with `GITHUB_TOKEN` requires this repository to have the Admin role in the package's *Manage Actions access* settings; without it the `clean-ghcr` job fails with a 403 and PR tags accumulate.

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Isolated Helm release per PR** (not a namespace per PR) | BC Gov Silver provides fixed namespaces (tools/dev/test/prod). Per-PR namespace creation is not permitted. An isolated release with a unique name and route achieves the same review isolation within the shared dev namespace. |
| **Per-PR database** (not a schema prefix) | The application configures only `DB_NAME` in its TypeORM DataSource — there is no schema-selection support. A separate database provides stronger isolation with zero application code changes. |

### Concurrency

The two workflows use **separate** concurrency groups:

- **`pr-deploy.yml`**: group `pr-env-<N>` with `cancel-in-progress: true` — a new push cancels any in-flight deploy for the same PR.
- **`pr-cleanup.yml`**: its own group `pr-env-cleanup-<N>` with `cancel-in-progress: false` — teardown runs are never cancelled, so a reopen's deploy can't interrupt an in-progress teardown mid-way and leak resources.

The reverse direction — a close/draft event arriving while a deploy is still running — is handled explicitly, not by the concurrency mechanism: `pr-cleanup.yml`'s preflight job cancels any queued or in-progress `pr-deploy.yml` runs for the PR's branch via `gh run cancel` before teardown proceeds.

Cleanup steps are idempotent (safe to re-run).
