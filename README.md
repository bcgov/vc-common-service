# VC Common Service

A multi-tenant API providing a format-agnostic abstraction layer for Verifiable Credential (VC) operations. The service normalizes issue/verify/hold patterns across credential formats and backend agents, enabling seamless integration of diverse credential ecosystems.

## Overview

The VC Common Service acts as a unified gateway for verifiable credential operations. It abstracts away the complexity of working with multiple credential formats and allows applications to interact with credentials through a standardized API.

### Key Features

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Isolated tenant environments with secure data segregation
- **Format-Agnostic Operations**: Support for multiple verifiable credential formats
- **Standardized API**: Consistent interfaces for issue, verify, and hold operations
- **Job Processing**: Asynchronous job queue for long-running operations
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean application shutdown with resource cleanup
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check endpoints for service monitoring

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - Progressive Node.js framework
- **Database**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Relational database
- **ORM**: [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) - Data persistence layer
- **Job Queue**: [pg-boss](https://github.com/timgit/pg-boss) - PostgreSQL-backed job queue
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.12.0 or higher
- Docker & Docker Compose (recommended)
- PostgreSQL 18+ (or use Docker)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   # With Docker Compose (recommended)
   docker compose up

   # Or locally with npm
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Database Migrations

Migrations run automatically when starting with Docker Compose. For local development:

```bash
npm run build
npm run migrate:up
```

See [DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md#database-migrations) for detailed migration instructions.
