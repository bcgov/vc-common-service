A Helm chart to deploy the VC Common Service (NestJS) on BC Gov OpenShift

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.25+ / OpenShift 4.12+
- Helm 3.8.0+
- An external PostgreSQL database and (optionally) a Keycloak instance
- A pre-provisioned `Secret` with database credentials (or set `secret.create=true`)

## Installing the Chart

```console
helm install vc-common-service ./charts/vc-common-service \
  -n <namespace> \
  -f charts/vc-common-service/values-dev.yaml
```

The [Values](#values) section lists all configurable parameters.

## Architecture

This chart deploys the VC Common Service (a NestJS modular monolith) to BC Gov
OpenShift. Key characteristics:

- **API Deployment** — HTTP service on container port `3000`; liveness and
  readiness probes on `/health/live`.
- **Migrations** — run as a `pre-install`/`pre-upgrade` Helm hook Job (same image,
  overridden command), gated by `migrations.enabled`. Running once per release
  (rather than as a per-pod init container) avoids concurrent migration runs
  across replicas and HPA scale-ups. Set `migrations.argocd.enabled=true` to also
  emit a `PreSync` hook for ArgoCD/GitOps.
- **Worker Deployment** — the same image with entrypoint `node dist/worker.js`
  and its own HPA, gated by `worker.enabled`.
- **Exposure** — an OpenShift `Route` by default; a Kubernetes `Ingress` is an
  optional alternative.
- **External dependencies** — PostgreSQL and Keycloak are treated as external,
  shared services (consumed via env vars and a `Secret`).
- **NetworkPolicies** — restrict ingress to the OpenShift router and declare
  explicit egress to PostgreSQL/Keycloak, with a DNS-allow policy so hostname
  resolution keeps working once egress rules are in effect.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| affinity | object | `{}` | Affinity for API pods |
| autoscaling.enabled | bool | `false` | Enable autoscaling for the API Deployment |
| autoscaling.maxReplicas | int | `3` | Maximum API replicas |
| autoscaling.minReplicas | int | `1` | Minimum API replicas |
| autoscaling.targetCPUUtilizationPercentage | int | `80` | Target average CPU utilization (percentage) |
| config | object | `{"DB_HOST":"","DB_LOGGING":"false","DB_NAME":"vc_common_service","DB_PORT":"5432","DB_SYNCHRONIZE":"false","LOG_LEVEL":"info","NODE_ENV":"production","PORT":"3000"}` | Non-secret application configuration, rendered into a ConfigMap and injected as environment variables into all containers. |
| extraEnv | list | `[]` | Extra plain environment variables appended to every container (name/value list) |
| extraEnvFrom | list | `[]` | Extra envFrom sources (configMapRef/secretRef) for every container |
| fullnameOverride | string | `""` | Override the fully qualified release name |
| image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Image pull policy |
| image.registry | string | `"ghcr.io"` | Container image registry (optional; omitted from the ref when empty) |
| image.repository | string | `"bcgov/vc-common-service"` | Container image repository. API, Worker and migrations share this image. |
| image.tag | string | `""` | Image tag (defaults to the chart appVersion when empty) |
| imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | Names of pre-created image pull secrets, e.g. `[{ name: my-registry }]` |
| ingress.annotations | object | `{}` | Ingress annotations |
| ingress.className | string | `""` | Ingress class name |
| ingress.enabled | bool | `false` | Expose the service via a Kubernetes Ingress |
| ingress.hosts | list | `[{"host":"chart-example.local","paths":[{"path":"/","pathType":"Prefix"}]}]` | Ingress hosts and paths |
| ingress.tls | list | `[]` | Ingress TLS configuration |
| livenessProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":3,"httpGet":{"path":"/health/live","port":"http"},"initialDelaySeconds":15,"periodSeconds":15,"timeoutSeconds":3}` | Liveness probe. IN-01 provides a minimal 200 at `/health/live`. |
| migrations.activeDeadlineSeconds | int | `300` | Maximum seconds the migration Job may run before Kubernetes marks it failed. Prevents hung migrations (e.g. waiting on a lock) from blocking a release indefinitely. |
| migrations.argocd | object | `{"enabled":false}` | Emit an ArgoCD PreSync hook annotation so migrations also run under GitOps (ArgoCD does not execute Helm hooks natively) |
| migrations.args | list | `["dist/apps/vc-common-service/src/migrate.js"]` | Migration entrypoint args |
| migrations.backoffLimit | int | `2` | Number of retries before the migration Job is marked failed (2 retries = 3 total attempts) |
| migrations.command | list | `["node"]` | Migration entrypoint command |
| migrations.enabled | bool | `false` | Run database migrations as a pre-install/pre-upgrade Helm hook Job. Runs exactly once per release before the app pods roll, avoiding the concurrent/every-boot execution that an init container would cause across replicas and HPA scale-ups. |
| migrations.hook | object | `{"deletePolicy":"before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded","types":"pre-install,pre-upgrade","weight":"-5"}` | Helm hook configuration for the migration Job. `pre-install,pre-upgrade` is fail-closed: a failed migration aborts the release and the old version keeps serving. NOTE: the migration runner (migrate.js) should still wrap its run in a Postgres advisory lock (pg_advisory_lock/unlock) as defence in depth, since TypeORM does not lock migrations by default. |
| migrations.hook.deletePolicy | string | `"before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded"` | Hook resource delete policy |
| migrations.hook.types | string | `"pre-install,pre-upgrade"` | Helm hook types that trigger the migration Job |
| migrations.hook.weight | string | `"-5"` | Hook execution order (lower weights run earlier) |
| migrations.resources | object | `{"limits":{"cpu":"250m","memory":"256Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"25m","memory":"128Mi"}}` | Resource requests/limits for the migration Job |
| migrations.waitForDB | object | `{"enabled":false,"image":"busybox","tag":"1.36","timeoutSeconds":60}` | Optional init container that blocks the migration until the database (DB_HOST:DB_PORT from the app config) is reachable |
| migrations.waitForDB.timeoutSeconds | int | `60` | Maximum seconds to wait for the database before failing with a clear error |
| nameOverride | string | `""` | Override the chart name |
| networkPolicy.database.enabled | bool | `true` | Allow API/Worker egress to PostgreSQL |
| networkPolicy.database.namespaceSelector | object | `{}` | Namespace selector matching the database namespace |

| networkPolicy.database.port | int | `5432` | Database port |
| networkPolicy.dnsEgress.enabled | bool | `true` | Allow DNS egress (required whenever any egress rule is enabled) |

| networkPolicy.enabled | bool | `true` | Enable NetworkPolicies |
| networkPolicy.ingress.enabled | bool | `true` | Allow ingress to the API from the OpenShift router |
| networkPolicy.ingress.routerNamespaceSelector | object | `{"policy-group.network.openshift.io/ingress":""}` | Namespace selector matching the OpenShift router namespace |

| networkPolicy.keycloak.namespaceSelector | object | `{}` | Namespace selector matching the Keycloak namespace |
| networkPolicy.keycloak.podSelector | object | `{}` | Pod selector matching the Keycloak pods |
| networkPolicy.keycloak.port | int | `443` | Keycloak port |
| nodeSelector | object | `{}` | Node selector for API pods |

| readinessProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":3,"httpGet":{"path":"/health/live","port":"http"},"initialDelaySeconds":10,"periodSeconds":10,"timeoutSeconds":3}` | Readiness probe. Uses `/health/live` until a dedicated readiness endpoint is added. |
| replicaCount | int | `1` | Number of API pod replicas (ignored when `autoscaling.enabled=true`) |
| resources | object | `{"limits":{"cpu":"250m","memory":"256Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"50m","memory":"128Mi"}}` | Resource requests and limits for the API container |
| route.annotations | object | `{}` | Additional annotations for the Route |
| route.enabled | bool | `true` | Expose the service via an OpenShift Route |
